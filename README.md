# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
It's a Credit Card Detection Project using Machine Learning 
Building a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud enhances security by identifying suspicious
transactions that deviate from typical spending patterns.
• Define the problem by clearly articulating the issue at hand, ensuring all aspects are thoroughly analyzed and
understood before proceeding with a solution
• Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to uncover key insights and patterns
• Utilized appropriate models for specific use cases and conducted effective training to optimize performance
• Enhanced integration and monitoring capabilities by optimizing and serializing the model
• Address ethical considerations
Technologies Used: Machine Learning, Logistic Regression, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.
